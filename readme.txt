Automatic Number Plate Recognition System
========================================

Introduction:
--------------
Welcome to the Automatic Number Plate Recognition System! This project is designed to automate the process of recognizing and extracting number plates from various sources such as real-time camera feeds, uploaded videos, and images. The system utilizes SQL, HTML, Flask, and various Python libraries to achieve its functionality.

Features:
----------
1. Login System:
   - Admin Dashboard: Accessible via login, provides control over the system.
   - User Management: Allows editing, deleting, and modifying user accounts.

2. Number Plate Recognition Tools:
   - Real-Time Recognition: Utilizes camera feed to perform number plate recognition in real time.
   - Video Recognition: Upload videos to extract number plates, organizing them into separate folders.
   - Image Recognition: Extracts number plates from uploaded images and stores them in a separate folder.

3. Result Section:
   - Provides access to the outputs of the number plate recognition tools.
   - Allows users to view and analyze the results obtained.

Dependencies:
--------------
To run the Automatic Number Plate Recognition System, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- SQL database (for user management)
- HTML/CSS (for front-end interface)
- Flask (for back-end server)
- Python libraries: Haarcascade classifier (for image processing), and import secrets imutils, uuid, mysql.connector and openCV libraries.

Installation and Setup:
------------------------
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the SQL database and configure the necessary tables for user management.
3. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:
   -pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start the Flask server by executing the main application file.
5. Access the Automatic Number Plate Recognition System via Chrome web browser.

Usage:
-------
1. Login to the admin dashboard using your credentials.
2. Navigate through the user management section to manage user accounts.
3. Utilize the number plate recognition tools to process real-time camera feeds, uploaded videos, and images.
4. Access the result section to view and analyze the extracted number plates.
